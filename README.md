## What is this?
A repo to polish up some code Harvey Marples and I wrote 2 years ago to simulate magnetic Skyrmions using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.
## What's in here?
Most of these files are for optimisation testing. However, the useful files are
`skyrmpy_functions.py`, which is a set of functions Harvey Marples created to:
* Numerically solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
* Initialise and diagnose topologically non-trivial magnetisation textures, such as Skyrmions.
* Compute magnetic susceptibilities.
and the fantastically named `simulation_attempt1.py`, which produces animations of the numerically obtained solutions.
